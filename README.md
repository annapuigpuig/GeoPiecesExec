The game consists of a series of campaigns that the students will have to finish in order to obtain complex 3D objects from simpler three-dimensional shapes. To gain them, it will be necessary to get first some 2D shapes and then build basic 3D objects through unfolding. Each campaign covers a set of ILOs (Intended Learning Outcomes).
